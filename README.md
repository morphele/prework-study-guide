# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to jot down notes for the Coding Bootcamp. It includes notes about working with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

The intention here was to have one central place to store key information learned during the course and to share that knowledge with other students who could benefit from it as well. It solves the problem of not knowing where to store learned information with the desire to share it with other students. In the  making of this study guide I learned some basic concepts and foundational methods of using the three languages to create websites.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
